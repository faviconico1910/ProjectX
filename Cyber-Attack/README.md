# Cyber Attack - Initial Access to Breached
---
## Setup Attacker machine
- Name our machine ``` project-x-attacker ```.
- Set IP address to ``` 10.0.0.5 ```.

## The Concept of Reconnaissance
- Also referred to as 'recon'. This is first phase of a cyber-attack where attackers gather information about their target to identify vulnerabilities they can exploit. This phase is all about preparation and involves collecting as much data as possible about the target's systems, network, employees, or infrastructure without triggering alarms.
